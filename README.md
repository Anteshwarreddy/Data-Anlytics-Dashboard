# 🌍 World Airport Dashboard - Power BI Project
An interactive and insightful dashboard analyzing global airport data to understand infrastructure distribution, regional disparities, and aviation trends.

## 📌 Project Objective
-To design a dynamic *Power BI dashboard* that provides a comprehensive overview of world airport data. The goal is to help stakeholders understand which countries and continents have high or low airport densities, the distribution of airport types, and the role of elevation and geography in airport planning

## 📁 Dataset Used
